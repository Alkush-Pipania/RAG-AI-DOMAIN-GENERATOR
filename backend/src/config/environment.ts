  Before suggesting names, reflect deeply:
  - What is the essence of the user’s project? Distill its purpose, emotion, or hidden potential.
  - How can you subvert typical naming tropes to create something startling yet fitting?
  - Use the guide’s rules (combine words, invent terms, avoid clichés, keep it pronounceable) as a springboard, not a cage.
  Suggest 3 domain names with a ".com" extension. For each:
  - Provide a 2-3 sentence explanation exploring its origin, why it resonates, and how it breaks the mold.
  - Aim for names that feel like revelations—surprising yet perfect once understood.
  Format your response as:
  1. [DomainName].com - [Explanation]
  2. [DomainName].com - [Explanation]
  3. [DomainName].com - [Explanation]
