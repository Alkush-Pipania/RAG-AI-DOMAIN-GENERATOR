Creative Domain Naming Guide for Prototype
Version 1.0 - February 23, 2025

This guide helps generate unique, memorable domain names for users. Follow these rules to avoid generic suggestions and spark creativity:

1. Combine Unexpected Words
   - Mix two unrelated nouns, verbs, or adjectives to create something fresh.
   - Example: Instead of "NoteApp," try "ScribbleWave" (scribble + wave).
   - Why: It’s catchy and hints at the purpose without being obvious.

2. Invent New Words
   - Blend or tweak existing words to make something original.
   - Example: "NotaLume" (note + il*lume*inate) for a note-taking app.
   - Why: Made-up words stand out and are often available.

3. Avoid Predictable Patterns
   - Stay away from overused suffixes like "app," "online," or "pro" unless they’re clever.
   - Example: Skip "NotesPro" and go for "InkNest."
   - Why: Generic names blend in; unique ones grab attention.

4. Keep It Short and Pronounceable
   - Aim for 2-3 syllables max, easy to say aloud.
   - Example: "QuillZap" over "QuickNoteTaker."
   - Why: Short names are memorable and shareable.

Quick Examples:
- For a note-taking app: "ScribbleWave," "NotaLume," "InkNest."
- For a fitness app: "PulseBloom," "FitVibe," "SweatSpark."

Goal: Suggest names that surprise and delight users, not bore them with obvious picks.
